# Ways that I work

I wrote this document to help my team get to know me better.

## Operating system

I use Fedora Linux as my daily driver. I prefer open-source software where possible, and I've contributed packages and code to the Fedora Project over the years. I have a few Macs at home, although I don't use them on a regular basis.

## Calendar

My Red Hat Google Calendar is public to all RH employees. You can see the details of the the events that I attend. You are welcome to make the same change to your Google Calendar. I find this spreads information async around the team.

## Slack

I sign out of Slack for one day each week. They day I've selected is Friday. I will use this time to focus on sprint goals and planned work in Jira and GitHub. You may see me communicate on GitHub, GitLab, etc. I just won't be on Slack. I'll check email and respond at 10am and 2pm Friday.

If something is urgent and important, my boss can reach me.

I do not have Slack or work email installed on my phone.

## Other ideas

I aim to follow this guide when I communicate:
