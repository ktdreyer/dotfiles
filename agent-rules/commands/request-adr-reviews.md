Review this task: $1

Create the sub-tasks under this ticket to review the ADR document.

Assign each of the sub-tasks to the members who are part of my current sprint `MidstreamIntegration Sprint 11` 

- Keep the review sub-task free of clutter. It should be brief and clear. Every ticket should have a one-sentence "Goal" statement at the top: `As a ___, I want to ____, so that ____.` Every ticket must have a bullet list of **Acceptance Criteria**. Each bullet is exactly one complete sentence.
- Use the `jira_create_issue` tool as `create_issue` seems to fail.
- Don't assign these tasks to user names that resolve into `<username>+aaiet@redhat.com`. Instead, assign them to the user names that resolve into `<username>@redhat.com`.
- Assign the `AAET DevOps` Component field
- The summary field of each sub-task should have a suffix with the assignee's name in order to distinguish them at a glance. For example, if you are assigning a ticket to "Ken", then the ticket should have "(Ken)" at the end of the summary.
- Make sure the parent ticket attributes are inherited to the child sub-tasks/tasks that are created as part of this exercise.

Draft the text and show it to me for approval before creating any issues.
