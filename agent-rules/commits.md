Always make Git commits on a feature branch instead of committing directly to "main".

Write commit messages that say "why", rather than "what".

Do not give a detailed list of changes that simply matches the git diff.

Use the active voice, imperative mood, and present tense.

Do not include "Fixes #" in commit messages. Only include that "Fixes #" information in GitHub PR descriptions.

Keep the first line under 60 characters for good Git log readability.
