When fixing a Jira ticket:

 - Do not post multiple comments in Jira.
 - Do not give wordy updates that repeat exactly what you've done in Git.
 - Simply give a brief, to-the-point one-sentence update.
 - Prompt the user to review the Jira comment prior to posting it.

When creating a Jira ticket:

1. Every ticket has a one-sentence "Goal" statement at the top: `As a ___, I want to ____, so that ____`
2. Every ticket has a bullet list of **Acceptance Criteria**. Each bullet is exactly one complete sentence.
3. Every ticket links to one of our team's Epics.
